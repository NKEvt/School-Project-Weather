## Slide 3 **Introduction**

I will do a research on Global Warming topic looking at how temperature change in my home town.
In this project I will be learning basics on how to conduct scientific project, how to write a a code to get and to analyze historical tempreature. 
To do this I will use Python, Weather API (Application Programming Interface), GitHub with Codespaces, and Chat GPT for help. I will write the code in GitHub Codespaces using the Python extension and then running it to get all the information I need to complete this project. ToSince I can't get and analyze the weather data for the whole world, I will be using the weather data for New Jersey to complete my project in time.


## Slide 3 (cont): **Introduction/Background**

1. **Software Development**:  
   Software development are steps of creating code or software that run on computers or hardware to achieve cirtain goals. For our project, the Python code helps to understand climate change.

2. **Python**:  
   Python is a programming language we use to write the code. It's easy to learn and is perfect for working with data in scientific projects like ours.

3. **Teamwork**:  
   Teamwork means working together to achieve a common goal. In our project, weâ€™re working as a team, with me (Nikita), my dad and ChatGpt as a virtual assistant.

4. **GitHub**:  
   GitHub is an Internet tool to store and share program's code. It helps us work on the project together, and allows us to keep track of changes to the code.

5. **Development Environment (on GitHub Codespace)**:  
   A development environment is a place to write and test a code. On GitHub Codespaces, we can work in the cloud from Internet browser on any computer. It makes software development easier.


## Slide 4 **Questions**

1. **Is there global warming in New Jersey?**  
2. **Can I write a program to predict future temperature?**  
3. **How to conduct real-life scientific project**?  


## Slide 5: **Background Research**

Global warming causes glaciers to melt, which causes the sea levels to rise, which could cause some of the states to get flooded. This is especially bad for New Jersey because it is right next to the ocean.
Global warming is making it harder for plants to grow in many places because of less water, which could cause problems like hunger for many people.  
Global warming can be very dangerous because of this reason.


## Slide 6: **Hypothesis**

I remember that the temperature in New Jersey seems to have gone up over time. I think I can write a computer program to show this and even predict what the weather might be like in the future! 

## Slide 7: **Variables**

* Independent Variable: Year (changing over time from January 1, 2010, to November 20, 2024, to analyze trends).
* Dependent Variable: Average temperature (observed and measured over time).
* Controlled Variables:  
  - Location: Jersey City, New Jersey.  
  - Data Type: Historical weather data (daily average temperatures).  
  - Time Range: January 1, 2010, to November 20, 2024.  
* Constant Variables:  
  - Measurement Units: Fahrenheit.  
  - Data Source: Open-Meteo.com.  
  - Calculation Method: Using the same formula for temperature trends and predictions.
